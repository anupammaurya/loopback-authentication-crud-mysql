# Loopback crud operation

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

# Authentication and auth setup

$ git clone https://github.com/anupammaurya/loopback-authentication-crud-mysql.git
$ cd loopback-crud
$ npm install
$ node .
```

In this example, we create some models to demonstrate authentication and authorization mechanisms in
LoopBack. The application consists of four types of users:

 - `books`
 - `BookDetails`

Each user type has permission to perform tasks based on their role and the
application's ACL (access control list) entries.
